# This solution computes the total sum of all numbers formed by root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree.
# It uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and build numbers along each path.
# The `cur_sum` is updated by multiplying by 10 and adding the current nodeâ€™s value to form the path number.

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited once.
# Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack (O(n) in the worst case of a skewed tree).

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
